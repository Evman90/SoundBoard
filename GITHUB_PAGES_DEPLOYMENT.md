# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for CallSound Pro

## Overview
Your CallSound Pro app is now fully browser-based and can be deployed to GitHub Pages. Here's how to do it properly.

## Prerequisites
- Your app is browser-only (no server dependencies)
- Uses IndexedDB for storage (no database needed)
- All audio processing happens in the browser

## Step 1: Build the Application

Run this command to build your app for production:

```bash
vite build --base=/CallSound-Pro/
```

This creates a `dist/public` folder with all your static files optimized for GitHub Pages.

## Step 2: GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** named exactly `CallSound-Pro`
2. **Push your code** to the repository
3. **Copy the built files** from `dist/public` to a `docs` folder in your repo root

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select `main` branch and `/docs` folder
5. Click "Save"

## Step 4: File Structure for Deployment

Your GitHub repository should look like this:

```
CallSound-Pro/
├── docs/                 # GitHub Pages will serve from here
│   ├── index.html       # Built version
│   ├── assets/          # Built CSS, JS, and other assets
│   └── ...              # Other built files
├── client/              # Your source code
├── server/              # Not used in GitHub Pages
├── shared/ 
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Step 5: Build Commands

Since we can't modify package.json directly, run these commands manually:

### For Development (testing locally):
```bash
cd client && vite dev
```

### For Production Build (GitHub Pages):
```bash
vite build --base=/CallSound-Pro/ --outDir=docs
```

## Step 6: Important Notes

1. **Base URL**: The `--base=/CallSound-Pro/` flag is crucial - it tells Vite that your app will be served from `username.github.io/CallSound-Pro/` instead of the root domain.

2. **Browser-Only**: Your app now works entirely in the browser:
   - Voice recognition via Web Speech API
   - Audio storage via IndexedDB 
   - Settings via localStorage
   - No server needed!

3. **HTTPS Required**: GitHub Pages serves over HTTPS, which is required for:
   - Microphone access (Web Speech API)
   - Service workers
   - Modern browser features

## Step 7: Testing

After deployment, your app will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/CallSound-Pro/`

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: App loads but voice recognition doesn't work
**Solution**: Make sure you're accessing via HTTPS (GitHub Pages default)

**Problem**: Files not loading correctly
**Solution**: Verify the base URL in build command matches your repository name

**Problem**: App shows blank page
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, ensure all paths are relative

## Alternative: Using GitHub Actions

For automated deployment, you can create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Build
      run: vite build --base=/CallSound-Pro/ --outDir=docs
      
    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./docs
```

This automatically builds and deploys when you push to main branch.
