Create a new repository named **exactly**: `CallSound-Pro`

### 2. Upload Your Files
Push these files to your GitHub repository:

│       ├── index-D_ycIwNe.js
│       └── index-CfjJb_cZ.css
├── README.md
└── (other project files - optional)
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: `main`
4. Folder: `/docs`
5. Save

### 4. Access Your App
After deployment (2-3 minutes), your app will be available at:
**`https://yourusername.github.io/CallSound-Pro/`**
